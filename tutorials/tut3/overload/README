HOW TO ATTEMPT TO COMPILE THIS PROGRAM:

You can attempt a compile to see whether an option for a foo overload will work.
However, you must follow the below instructions to include the definition of
an overloaded version.

Below each option, there is a line like: #ifdef X, where X is A,B,C,or D.
When compiling, you should use the following command:
(assuming the aliases are set)

g++14 -DX overload.cc

With the X replaced with A,B,C,or D as appropriate.
